# SilkBuilder™: SQL's Missing Friend

SilkBuilder is SQL's Missing Friend, an innovative, opinionated development framework that streamlines the creation of dynamic, data-driven web applications by serving as a seamless companion to SQL. It bridges the gap between robust database interactions and intuitive user interface development, providing developers with a cohesive, efficient environment for building modern web solutions.

## SQL Seamlessly Integration

At its core, SilkBuilder leverages the power and familiarity of SQL for database interactions, ensuring developers can utilize their existing knowledge of structured query language to manage data with precision and flexibility. Whether performing complex queries, managing transactions, or handling large datasets, SilkBuilder’s SQL integration simplifies backend logic while maintaining compatibility with any modern database that supports JDBC drivers.

## Custom Tags and JavaScript Frontend

For the front end, SilkBuilder introduces a unique approach by combining custom JSP (Jakarta Server Pages) tags with paired JavaScript Objects. The custom JSP tags enable developers to create reusable, modular components that encapsulate dynamic functionality, reducing the complexity of traditional JSP development and promoting clean separation of concerns. These tags work in tandem with JavaScript Classes to deliver highly interactive and responsive user interfaces, making it easy to craft engaging web experiences without relying on heavyweight JavaScript frameworks.

## Agile Development is the Core Objective

SilkBuilder’s design, centered on Agile Development and Rapid Application Development (RAD), offers several key advantages for developers seeking a fast, efficient approach to building web applications. Developers can deliver scalable, maintainable web applications quickly, responding to feedback and evolving requirements with ease.

## Open-Source

SilkBuilder Framework packages and uses open-source libraries and resources. The list and licenses of these are [found here](https://silkbuilder.com/toolbox#open-source).
